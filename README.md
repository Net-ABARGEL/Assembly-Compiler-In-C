Assembly Compiler in C

This project is an Assembly language compiler written in C. The compiler takes Assembly code as input and generates machine code that can be executed on a specific architecture. This project is designed to provide a basic understanding of the compilation process and assembly language.

Features

Assembly Language Support: The compiler supports a subset of Assembly language instructions.
Code Generation: Translates Assembly code into machine code for a specific architecture.
Basic Optimization: Implements simple optimizations to improve generated code efficiency.
Prerequisites

C compiler (e.g., GCC)

Contributing

Feel free to contribute by submitting issues or pull requests. Contributions are welcome!

Acknowledgments
